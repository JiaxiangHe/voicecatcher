real time pitch detector by webRTC and AudioContext

![](https://github.com/JiaxiangHe/voicecatcher/raw/master/public/sample.jpg "sample")

It's easy to catch users' voice throght webRTC in browser and do something interesting with AudioContext.

It works well on most current desktop and mobile browsers except Safari. Seems you need third part APP to do the expriement on IOS like Wechat.
